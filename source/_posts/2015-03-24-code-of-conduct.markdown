**Code of Conduct for Team Tessie, Rails Girls Summer of Code 2015

This code of conduct applies to our actions within the team, as well as in our
involvement with RGSoC and with other projects and companies.

As our work will affect a wider community, we feel it is important to write down
the things that we feel "go without saying", so that there is no doubt about how
we plan to conduct ourselves throughout RGSoC.

Within our team, we treat one another with respect and keep open communication
about difficulties we might be having. This includes difficulties with the project
as well as possible situations in our personal lives that could affect our work.

We are supportive of each other. We are considerate of the point of view of our
teammate and where necessary, offer constructive criticism.

In the unlikely even of conflict arising, we approach the situation with an open
mind and preferably, before any problem has been able to escalate.

Our team believes in a working environment that is open, friendly and welcoming
to anyone who works with us.

We do not discriminate against anybody. We recognise that there are many
specific attributes that are used to discriminate against people. These include
(but are not limited to): age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity or expression,
national origin, physical or mental difference, politics, race, religion, sex,
sexual orientation, socio-economic status, and subculture. We welcome people
regardless of the values of these or other attributes.

We are courteous and respectful to others who are volunteering their time to
help us in our project. This includes respecting agreed-upon times in which
we can ask for support from our supervisor, mentors, and coaches.

If we are considered to be in breach of our code of conduct, by ourselves or by
those with whom we are working, we will address the complaint with our
supervisor.
