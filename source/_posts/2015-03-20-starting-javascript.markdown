-  the boolean one was the first one I had to get a hint for. Even though I'm familiar with boolean logic, I wasn't sure how to use it in Javascript and the explanation didn't really show an example first.
-  examples of pre-written code where we have to fix it to do a certain thing are awesome. Makes you feel like you get it and it works :D
-  being a perfectionist, I just had to knw why the equal to and not equal to operator had one "=" more than C++ As usual, found a really great and interesting answer on stack overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359494/does-it-matter-which-equals-operator-vs-i-use-in-javascript-comparisons
