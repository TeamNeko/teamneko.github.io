<td cellpadding="10"> <p align="justify">Shelly was born in 1986 in a tiny village in the west of Ireland. She grew up there with her family, pet goat, various cats, dogs and goldfish.</p>

<p>In 2005 she left the village to the big bright lights of Galway. Here she studied English and Classics in NUI Galway. Upon graduating, Shelly realised that she had no clue what she wanted to be when she grew up. Having studied French up to first year of college, she decided to look for an aupair job in a french speaking country, and improve her language skills. Naturally, she ended up in a small town in the North West of Hungary two weeks later. She stayed here for just under a year, making lots of friends in Vienna in this time.</p>

<p>Upon returning to Galway in October 2009, Shelly quickly landed a job in an arts/crafts/toy shop where she worked for almost two years, eventually made it up to assistant manager. She still felt restless however, and when a good friend in Vienna said that she was moving out of her ridiculously cute apartment, Shelly declared “This means nothing to me! Oh Vienna!” and was once more on a plane departing the soggy shores of Ireland.</p>

<p>After swearing off childcare jobs, Shelly found out that a lack of German meant that any other jobs were hard to come by. She worked as a nanny, and then as an English teacher in a montessori. Upon finishing at the montessori, she got a job in a different kindergarten tucked away in a quiet suburb of Vienna. Quiet kindergartens aren&rsquo;t terribly inspirational so Shelly decided to be proactive. In March 2014 Shelly began to learn Python. She also dabbled in Ruby, HTML, CSS and in October, attended a Ruby on Rails workshop. It was here that she realised how open and inclusive the community is. Shelly began to attend different meetups and workshops and slowly but surely started to get to know other people who are also learning.</p>

<p>At one of the Vienna.rb meetups, Shelly was introduced to Pilar. Here they began to plot and conspire about RGSoC 2015. Since this meeting, they have spoken about what they both want to achieve from the program, what they both know so far, and what their favourite sea monsters are. Their first official RGSoC meeting to assemble their application was held in Cafe Neko, a cat cafe. This led to their temporary team name being Team Neko, which was then vetoed due to a gaming blog called Team Neko UK. This brought them back to sea monsters, and team Tessie was born.</p>

<p>In the last year, Shelly has been learning as much as she can, but this is difficult when working a full time job, babysitting 10-15 hours per week, and being a cat lady in training. A huge boost to her motivation came when attending Webcamp Zagreb. A year before that, her partner had spoken at this conference and instead of attending, Shelly went sightseeing and got lost in Zagreb. While it might not seem like such a big point, in one year she went from not understanding enough to attend a conference (regardless of the fact that all talks were in Croatian that year), to attending the (now English speaking) conference a year later, and not just understanding the talks but learning even more after seeing them. She was also pleased to have understood many of the little in-jokes that were peppered through the talks. She has submitted a talk about RGSoC to Webcamp Zagreb 2015, with a sidenote that the subject of the talk does depend on whether or not she and Pilar are successful in their application.</p>

<p>Shelly&rsquo;s future plans are to work in tech, and to help fight the lack of diversity in this industry from within. RGSoC would help massively towards this goal. While she has learned quite a lot in the last year, it is still a limited amount due to the fact that her current job is both physically and mentally draining. With the ability to exclusively learn for three months, there is no doubt that this is a life-changing opportunity. While “work in tech” is a quite vague statement, it is meant in the sense that through completing RGSoC, Shelly will have a solid understanding of her strengths and weaknesses and what area of tech is best suited for her future career. The current hope is to work as a junior developer after completing the program, with particular interest in companies that actively work to help people (whether environmentally, health related, or otherwise).</p>

<p>While Shelly has come to computing in quite a roundabout way, her enthusiasm and commitment to learning should not be doubted. For the first time in years, something has really clicked and is not only enjoyable, but hugely interesting.</p>

<p>Shelly asked someone to write this for her so that the use of third person narrative would be genuine. They refused. </p></td>
