	<h2 class="title">Project Plan and Ruby Habits</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>We had a wonderfully active day on Tuesday, March 31st. Not only did we get a
more solid idea of our project plan, but we also attended (and in Pilar&rsquo;s case,
organised) Ruby Habit&rsquo;s meetup, focussing on Git.</p>

<p>In the morning, Jan from Hoodie was kind enough to join us for a video call in
which we quizzed him on suitable project ideas. He gave us a written summary of
everything that he thought would be suitable for our level, and then explained
everything in detail during the call. Of course, many aspects of the projects
about which we spoke are above our level, but not to the extent that we would not
be able to do them. There is a clear progression of level throughout the project
involvement, which we are both quite excited about!</p>

<p>About a week before this call with Jan, I had some difficulty in setting up Hoodie
on my machine, so I called out for help on Twitter. Ola from Hoodie was really
quick to reply with an offer of help and several different methods by which to
contact her to chat about the problems I was having. Her help was wonderful and
as a result, Hoodie is now fully functional on my machine! I have yet to make a
good enough app to share, but I am enjoying getting to know how it all works. I
mentioned to Ola that myself and Pilar are submitting a RGSoC application and
she told me that not only was she already aware of this, but that we could list
her on our application as one of our mentors.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Awesome to see how passionate <a href="https://twitter.com/shellycoen">@shellycoen</a> already is about her RG SoC project. &lt;3</p>&mdash; Ola (@misprintedtype) <a href="https://twitter.com/misprintedtype/status/580112494024372224">March 23, 2015</a></blockquote>


<p> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Jan has invited us to begin contributing to the project already, which we are both
planning to do. In my own case however, I need to get to a better level of
knowledge of Javascript before I dive in. Luckily Jan and Ola are on hand to
help us out if and when we need it, and of course our coaches are too!</p>

<p>That evening, we all met once more in Rochuspark for Ruby Habits. Although this
group is still in its early days, there is a wonderful sense of openness and
friendliness amongst the attendees. With such a relaxed atmosphere, I find it
really easy to ask questions and to learn.</p>

<p>One of the Ruby Habits members, Yanko,  had offered to present a beginners level
introduction to Git and Github. While the subjects discussed were more or less
things myself and Pilar were already familiar with, it was great to clarify some
other &lsquo;not quite so clear&rsquo; aspects of Git.</p>

<p>We began the workshop with some exercises led by Yanko (get the blood flowing so
that nobody falls asleep!) and then an explanation of the basics of Git. Yanko
was a very good presenter on the subject, and even continued to teach us after a
short break following almost fainting! That&rsquo;s quite the amount of dedication!</p>

<p>Our homework after Ruby Habits was to contribute to the repo set up on Ruby Habits
github page. I personally ran into problems, given my limited access to the repo
itself. It helped me to get more practice with pull requests, which is always
good!</p>

<p>All in all, our Tuesday was a wonderfully productive one. Now that we have a more
solid project plan in place, it helps us to see where we are going and what we
should focus on in particular in order to learn loads over the summer!</p>
